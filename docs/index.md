# Table of contents

Baserow is an open-source online database tool. Users can use this no-code platform to
create a database without any technical experience. It lowers the barriers to app
creation so that anyone who can work with a spreadsheet can also create a database. The
interface looks a lot like a spreadsheet. Our goal is to provide a perfect and fast user
experience while keeping it easy for developers to write plugins and maintain the
codebase. The developer documentation contains several topics you might need as a
developer.
